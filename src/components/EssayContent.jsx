      <h2>
        I<br></br>
        <br></br>AI IS A MARKETING TERM
      </h2>

      <p>
        Critical AI researchers insist that &quot;AI&quot; is not a
        technological term, but rather a marketing<sup>[ 1 ]</sup> tool wielded
        by technocapitalists to sustain illusions of near-magical, technological
        progress. This &quot;progress&quot; is, in reality, a system built upon
        the exploitation and extraction of natural and human resources from
        minoritized communities in the Global North. Consider the traumatized
        and underpaid data workers in Kenya<sup>[ 2 ]</sup>, the unsafe
        extraction of cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo
        <sup>[ 3 ]</sup>, the uncompensated harvesting of artists&apos; data
        <sup>[ 4 ]</sup>, and in Chile, water scarcity worsens as data centers
        devour millions of gallons of fresh water<sup>[ 5 ]</sup>. While these
        exploitative practices are visible on a global scale, they also manifest
        in more intimate, localized spaces. To trace how Generative AI, as a
        technocapitalist product, takes root and is cultivated within
        microcommunities, I turn to a familiar ecosystem-the Black hair braiding
        industry.
      </p>
      <p className="body-text">
        Although celebrated as an art form, Black hair braiding is, in fact, a
        practice guided by ethnomathematical principles<sup>[ 6 ]</sup>.
        Translation determines the spacing between rows, tessellation forms
        geometric patterns on the scalp, rotation curves the braid’s path,
        reflection ensures symmetry, and dilation controls braid
        expansion/contraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every few weeks, 38% of Black women<sup>[ 6 ]</sup>, myself included,
        engage in this ethnomathematically-guided ritual. We braid, unbraid and
        re-braid. On average, we devote six hours per session and invest
        approximately $250 per appointment. This microeconomy, primarily driven
        by Black women entrepreneurs and sustained by the preferences of Black
        femme consumers, is structured around decentralized networks of care:
        from hairstyle selection, braider recommendation/identification, hair
        product review to braid maintainance. Yet, it exists within &quot;the
        bounds of the white supremacist patriarchal state, macrocosmically, and
        the Black male head of the patriarchal family, microcosmically.&quot;
        <sup>[ 7 ]</sup> Hair discrimination-that all-too-familiar form of
        racial bias characterized by the hyperregulation and hypersurveillance
        of Black hair textures plays a critical role in shaping both consumer
        demand and pricing models. For example: lightweight, non-voluminous
        braids made with human-like synthetic hair, often prized for their
        semblance to non-coily textures, command higher prices than hairstyles
        braided with kanekalon, a coarse synthetic fiber.
      </p>
      <p>
        As generative AI advances, I find myself drawn to the question of how it
        might transform this microeconomy. Can I possibly abstract, encode, and
        model these networks of care into a multimodal generative framework? If
        such a system were developed, to what extent could it be commodified?
        What economic model would support its viability? And what price point
        would users be willing to accept for such a product?

        <br></br>WHAT IS DA BRAIDR?
      </h2>
      <p className="body-text">
        Da Braidr is a conceptual AI startup designed to critically examine how
        multimodal generative systems-specifically visual and conversational
        agents-might reconfigure the socioeconomic dynamics of the Black hair
        braiding industry. The vision for Da Braidr stemmed from my decade-long
        experience as a client to West African immigrant braiders in Harlem, New
        York. Through the often-invisible labor of braiding, these women support
        their families, both near and distant. A child’s desire for yet another
        pair of limited-edition Air Jordans. Aid for a niece grappling with the
        stigma of single motherhood. A household left behind by an incarcerated
        child. A once-employed child, now a social media influencer. A
        relative’s ESL tuition. Medical bills for a sibling’s partner.
        Healthcare for aging parents.
      </p>

      <p className="body-text">
        Although the 2019 U.S. CROWN Act<sup>[ 8 ]</sup> prohibits hair-based
        discrimination, transactions between the braider and the braided remain
        overdetermined by the lingering forces of the &quot;cultural bomb&quot;
        <sup>[ 9 ]</sup>-that is, racially-coded grooming standards that
        systemically force Black folks to &quot;identify with that which is
        furthest removed from themselves&quot;<sup>[ 10 ]</sup>. What might
        appear as a simple grooming choice is, in fact, a decision with
        far-reaching consequences for one’s economic and social mobility. As
        Joseph-Salisbury & Connelly (2018) remind us: &quot;If your hair is
        relaxed, white people are relaxed. If your hair is nappy, they&apos;re
        not happy.&quot;<sup>[ 11 ]</sup> Which braid will pass the test of the
        White gaze? Will it conform to school dress codes or be condemned as
        &quot;unkempt,&quot; &quot;extreme...faddish and out of control&quot;?
        Is it deemed appropriate in professional settings, for a job interview,
        or to ensure job security and advancement-or will it foreclose those
        opportunities? Can the braids be modified to minimize its association
        with the stereotype of the &quot;Black criminal&quot; or the &quot;the
        angry Black woman&quot;? Is it deemed &quot;too ghetto&quot; or
        &quot;too ethnic&quot;? Too &quot;Afrocentric&quot;? Can a particular
        braid pattern ensure quicker passage through TSA checkpoints? How will
        healthcare providers perceive it-unhygienic or unclean? Will the braid,
        ultimately, affect the quality of care a patient receives?
      </p>

      <p className="body-text">
        What happens when these critical decisions between the braider and the
        braided are replaced by generative systems? To what extent might image
        generation substitute the ritual of doomscrolling Instagram for braid
        inspirations? To what extent can conversational agents exploit and
        commodify the psychohairapeutic<sup>[ 12, 13, 14 ]</sup> exchanges
        between braiders and clients-exchanges forged in the shared struggle
        against a world that polices Black hair? Can such a system meaningfully
        model the braiding traditions nurtured by Black women in backyards,
        courtyards, front porsches and even on plantations? Can it capture the
        towering elegance of the Nigerian Yoruba &quot;Shuku&quot; hairstyle or
        the escape routes<sup>[ 15 ]</sup> braided into cornrows by enslaved
        Afro-Colombian women?{" "}
